### What I learned

So many cool ðŸ˜Ž things:

- []()
- []()
- Fluid typography
  - [An accessible fluid type generator](https://fluid.style/type?min=2.25&max=4.5&min-bp=20&max-bp=77.5&unit=%22rem%22)
  - [Responsive Type and Zoom](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/12/responsive-type-and-zoom.html)

  - [Modern Fluid Typography Using CSS Clamp](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/)
    - [Modern fluid typography editor](https://modern-fluid-typography.vercel.app/)
- Fonts and Line Height
  - [Text Crop tool](https://text-crop.eightshapes.com/?typeface-selection=google-font&typeface=Josefin%20Sans&custom-typeface-name=Helvetica&custom-typeface-url=&custom-typeface-weight=400&custom-typeface-style=normal&weight-and-style=300&size=72&line-height=1&top-crop=2&bottom-crop=18)
    - [Cropping Away Negative Impacts of Line Height](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/cropping-away-negative-impacts-of-line-height-84d744e016ce)
    - [Contrast Grid tool](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) - Another very cool tool, unrelated to fonts and line height, but awesome nonetheless.

### Continued development

Specific areas that the solution should be improved (known issues):

- Turn the header into some sort of sticky header that stays around as the user scrolls down the page (at least in the mobile view)
- Make sure the design works down to 320px viewport width
  - "experiences" in the h1 title goes beyond the containing box

More general ideas I want to consider:

Hmm ðŸ¤” ...
